# Restaurants-Search" 

A React-Native application that uses the Yelp API in order to find restaurants in your area.

You can use the search bar to find a restaurant by its name or by a food category.

The restaurants are categorised by price. In the first screen you can also see the ratting system being stars and the number of reviews each restaurant has. If you touch one restaurant from the carousel flatlist you enter the bussiness page where you can see its details: location, phone number and photos of the products. You also have another separate screen that is activated when you press a button where you can see the reviews it has.
To run this project, download the .zip and in your terminal run npm start.
